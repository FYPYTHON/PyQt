key: "${path}",
key: "%{path}"

The syntax for referencing keys is identical to the syntax for environment variables:

${KEY}

Where KEY is the name of the key.

For example, imagine that the keystore contains a key called ES_PWD with the value yourelasticsearchpassword:

In the configuration file, use output.elasticsearch.password: "${ES_PWD}"
On the command line, use: -E "output.elasticsearch.password=\${ES_PWD}"
